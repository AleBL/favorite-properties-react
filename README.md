First, the Orulo API properties are loaded and displayed in a paginated way, the user can mark the property as a favorite or view more details of the property, it is also possible to click on the image to view a larger version.

In the details a modal is opened showing more information such as bathrooms, bedrooms, suites, description and address (including a Google Maps component).
